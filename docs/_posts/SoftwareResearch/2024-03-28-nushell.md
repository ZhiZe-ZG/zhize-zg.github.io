## Introduction

Nushell is a cross-platform shell developed in Rust. Compared with traditional Bash, it further organizes the data in the pipeline into structures such as lists or tables, and performs some filtering and search functions based on this. But essentially you are still passing text, unlike PowerShell where you can pass objects directly through the pipeline.
