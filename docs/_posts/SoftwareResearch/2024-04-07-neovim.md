## Introduction

Neovim is a reimplementation of Vim. It throws away a lot of Vim's historical baggage. For example, it uses Lua instead of VimScript for extensions. In addition, it is designed to be easily embedded into other systems. For example, you can use VS Code as the front end and call Neovim as the back end for text editing.
