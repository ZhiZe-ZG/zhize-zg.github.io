## Introduction

7-Zip is a multifunctional archive compression and decompression tool that can compress or decompress multiple formats. It also has its own unique 7z format and corresponding LZMA compression algorithm. In addition, it also comes with some functions such as verification algorithms. In addition, it also has the function of calculating file check codes.

Earlier it was mainly limited to Windows, but now it has official support for Linux and Mac. However, it is not yet popular in some distributions. For example, in Arch Linux, `7-zip-full` belongs to AUR.

In addition to the GUI version, command line operation is also provided.
