## Introduction

GNU Emacs is a fairly complex software. It is generally thought of as a text editor, but it is actually a runtime environment for a programming language called Emacs Lisp. In addition, it has a lot of built-in functions, and it is completely feasible to even use Emacs as a GUI window manager. Therefore, to a certain extent, the experience of using emacs is close to that of an operating system.

Normally we use the GUI version of Emcas. But it also offers a TUI version. The TUI version can be started by using the `-nw` parameter after the Emacs command:

```shell
emacs -nw
```
