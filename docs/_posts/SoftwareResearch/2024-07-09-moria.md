## Introduction

A dungeon crawler game. It's the begin of rogue-like games. It was the first roguelike to have a "Town" level.

Moria changed developers and development languages ​​several times. To distinguish it from the original Moria developed by Robert A. Koeneke using VMS BASIC, later versions (since James E. Wilson took the source code) were renamed Umoria.

On Debian based systems, you can install Moria by:

```bash
sudo apt install moria
```

and launch it by:

```bash
moria
```
