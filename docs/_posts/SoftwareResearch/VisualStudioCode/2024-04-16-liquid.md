## Introduction

This plugin provides support for Liquid.

Liquid is an extension of HTML. It is difficult for VS Code to distinguish whether a file has a Liquid extension just from the suffix name. When the Liquid code in a file with the suffix `.html` is not highlighted, please click the language mode in the lower right corner of the VS Code window and select Liquid mode manually.
