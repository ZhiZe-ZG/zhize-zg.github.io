## Introduction

Use the GitHub Copilot to generate some code. It can save you some repetitive work. You can also use it to do some miscellaneous things such as filling in commit comments, but don't have too high expectations of it.

The service this plugin depends on is chargeable. Moreover, not only is Copilot not open source, but it seems that the plugin itself is not open source either. It's quite ironic that a gathering place for the open source community has launched a non-open source project.

If you don't want your code to be collected by Copilot for training data, it's best to set it up on GitHub's webpage (although I don't know if this is really useful).

Also, this plugin is bundled with GitHub Copilot Chat.
