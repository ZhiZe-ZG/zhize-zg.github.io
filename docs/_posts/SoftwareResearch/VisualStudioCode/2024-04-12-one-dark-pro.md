## Introduction

Yet another One Dark theme imitator. It provides several One Dark variant. I used it for a time, until I found One Dark Darker.

I'm not a person who particularly likes to change appearance themes. Stable display of important information, comfort plus a bit of aesthetics is good enough for me. I only kept the set of themes I used and didn't install any other themes. I even disabled all the themes that come with VS Code.
