## Introduction

Conda is a cross-platform package management software that can manage binary files and system environment variables, so it is often used for development environment management. Although it has the ability to manage development environments of many languages, it is still mainly used to manage Python development environments.

Miniconda and Anaconda are two installation packages that include Conda. They differ in the number of Conda packages packaged. These packages can be downloaded from [Anaconda Package Source](https://anaconda.org/) using Conda. Therefore it is recommended to install the Miniconda which is simpler and smaller.
