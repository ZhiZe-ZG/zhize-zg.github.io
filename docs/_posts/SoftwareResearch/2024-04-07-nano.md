## Introduction

Mode-less plain text editor for TUI with support for Unicode characters. The shortcut guide is displayed by default at startup. This makes it easier to use than Vim or Emacs. It can be used for temporary editing of plain text in a GUI-less environment. Using nano in other scenarios may feel that the functionality is insufficient. However, if you do not have high requirements for the functionality of a plain text editor, you can mainly use it.
