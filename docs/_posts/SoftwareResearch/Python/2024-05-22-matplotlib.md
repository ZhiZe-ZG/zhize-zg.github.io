## Introduction

A Python package for data visualization. Its API design is not very clear.

It provides some basic graphical interfaces([BÃ©zier curve](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/artists/paths.html#bezier-example) and [3d porjection](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/toolkits/mplot3d.html) etc.). However, these interfaces are rarely used, and encapsulated interfaces are mainly used for data visualization.
