## Introduction

Ex (also write as "ex") is an extended version ed written by Bill Joy. To some extent, its code was the basis for Bill Joy's later development of vi. But from the perspective of software usage, it and vi are independent of each other.

Its code is released bundled with vi in [The Traditional Vi](https://ex-vi.sourceforge.net/).
