## Introduction

Windows Notepad was originally a plain text editor that came with Windows systems. But now, it has become a removable component in the Windows system. It can now be installed or uninstalled in the Windows Store. It has basic plain text file browsing and editing functions and supports search and replacement. It can be used when no other text editors are available on Windows.
