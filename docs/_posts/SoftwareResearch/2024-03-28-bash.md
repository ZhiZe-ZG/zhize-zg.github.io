## Introduction

Bash is a classic Linux shell, but it is old and some designs of it are no longer meet modern needs. Although it is set as the default shell by many distributions, in actual use there are many other options.

GNU Bash is generally started through the `bash` command, but it also provides a `sh` command, which is started in a manner compatible with `sh` on Unix to ensure accurate execution of scripts. For more, refer to:

* [Bash Startup FIles](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Startup-Files.html)

This can be considered as a special startup mode instead of launching another software.
