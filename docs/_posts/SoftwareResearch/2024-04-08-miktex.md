## Introduction

The MiKTeX project reimplements TeX and related software, providing package management software and a TeX package distribution source. These all comes together to form a distribution of a typography toolkit.

MiKTeX has its own package index, so there is no need to reference CTAN when documenting packages for MiKTeX.

Basic TeX, LaTeX, BibTeX and other components are installed by default. These packages usually start with `miktex`. They are not detailed in introductions about MiKTeX packages.
