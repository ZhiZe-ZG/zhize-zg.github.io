Collections are units for Jekyll to manage pages. Pages under the same collection are generally stored in the same folder, and Front Matter default values can be set uniformly in `_config.yml`. In addition, Jekyll will also create a traversal list for the pages in the collection to facilitate the writing of index pages, etc.

`posts` is a collection provided by Jekyll by default. In addition, `pages` that do not belong to other collections can also be regarded as a collection.

Here is some official documentation about collections:

* [Jekyll DOCS: Collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/)
* [Minimal Mistakes DOCS: Working with Collections](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/collections/)

## Create Collections

Collections need to be defined in `_config.yml`. Collections can be defined by enumerating the names of collections in the variable `collections`. You can also write each definition of a collection into a dictionary, and the key-value pairs in the dictionary will set the properties of the collection.

For example:

```yml
collections:
  knowledge-taxonomy:
    output: true
    permalink: /:collection/:path/
  zz-ci:
    output: true
    permalink: /:collection/:path/
  zz-shi:
    output: true
    permalink: /:collection/:path/
  zz-zi:
    output: true
    permalink: /:collection/:path/
  zz-yi:
    output: true
    permalink: /:collection/:path/
```

Here, `knowledge-taxonomy`, `zz-ci` and `zz-shi` etc. are collections. `output: true` make pages in the collection visible. If this item is set to `false`, the corresponding web page will not be generated.

`permalink` set the access path of pages in the collection. The `:collection` means the name of the collection and the `:path` means the relative path of the page in the collection. For more about the grammar of values of `permalink`, refer to [Jekyll DOCS: Permalinks](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/).

After setting in the `_config.yml`. You need create a folder for your collection. The folder name is your collection name preceded by `_`. Pages in this folder are regard as the members of the collection.

## Default Front Matter Values

After creating a collection, you can set the default values of Front Matter for pages in the collection. The setting method is similar to posts. The newly created collection needs to correspond to a new `defaults` entry, and the name of the collection is specified in the `scope` item.

A `defaults` with default values for `posts` and `knowledge-taxonomy` would look like this:

```yml
defaults:
  # posts
  - 
    scope:
      path: ""
      type: posts
    values:
      category: Uncategorized
      layout: single
      author_profile: true
      show_date: true    
      read_time: true
      share: true
      related: true
      toc: true
  # knowledge-taxonomy
  - 
    scope:
      path: ""
      type: knowledge-taxonomy
    values:
      layout: single
      author_profile: true
      show_date: true
      read_time: true
      share: true
      related: true
      toc: true
```

## Generate Index Pages for Collections

You can also create index page for each collection. Minimal Mistakes provides a dedicated layout `collection` for this purpose. Create a page, use `collection` layout and specify the collection name in the `collection` variable of Front Matter, and you will get the index page of this collection. For example:

```markdown
---
layout: collection
title: "Knowledge Taxonomy"
collection: knowledge-taxonomy
permalink: /knowledge-taxonomy/
---

Documents listing for the collection `_knowledge-taxonomy`.
```

You can also list all the collections in one page. For example, this is a Liquid fragment to list all the collections and their members.

```HTML
{% raw %}
Pages in collections:

{% for collection in site.collections%}
<h2>{{collection.label}}</h2>
{% for item in collection.docs %}
  <h2>
    <a href="{{ item.url }}">
      {{ item.title }}
    </a>
  </h2>
{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
{% endraw %}
```

If you don't want to include the posts collection, use this:

```HTML
{% raw %}
Pages in collections:

{% assign pure_collections = site.collections | where_exp:"item", "item.label != 'posts'"%}
{% for collection in pure_collections%}
<h2>{{collection.label}}</h2>
{% for item in collection.docs %}
  <h2>
    <a href="{{ item.url }}">
      {{ item.title }}
    </a>
  </h2>
{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
{% endraw %}
```

## Usage Advices of Collections

According the advice from this article [Jekyll Collections: What Collections Are](https://jekyll-one-org.github.io/pages/public/learn/bookshelf/jekyll_collections/), you can use collections to group together articles that are logically related but whose writing time is not important.

There is a very clear illustration in the article, which is reproduced in mermaid as follows:

<pre class="mermaid">
flowchart TD
    QLogic[Can the things be logically grouped?]
    QDate[Are they grouped by date?]
    UPages[Use pages]
    UPosts[Use Posts]
    UCollection[Use a collections]

    QLogic -- No --> UPages
    QLogic -- Yes --> QDate
    QDate -- No --> UCollection
    QDate -- Yes --> UPosts
</pre>

But in my opinion, logical classification is still more important than the writing date, so I recommend following this process to make decisions for a new article:

<pre class="mermaid">
flowchart TD
    QTopic[Can it be subsumed into an existing custom collection?]
    QRelatives[Are there other articles like this or will you write more on this topic?]
    QQuantity[Are there many of them or is the topic important enough?]
    QUnique[Is it so unique that it needs a dedicated display?]

    UTopic[Use this collection]
    CTopic[Create a new collection and move existing related articles there]
    UPosts[Post as usual posts]
    UPostsTaxonomy[Use posts and label categories and tags accurately]
    CPage[Create as new page and create a unique link]

    QTopic -- Yes --> UTopic
    QTopic -- No --> QRelatives
    QRelatives -- Yes --> QQuantity
    QQuantity -- Yes --> CTopic
    QQuantity -- No --> UPostsTaxonomy
    QRelatives -- No --> QUnique
    QUnique -- Yes --> CPage
    QUnique -- No --> UPosts
</pre>

In terms of source code management, posts placed in subfolders of the `_posts` will also be recognized. Moreover, if you do not use `:path` in permalink, the actual storage path of the source code will not affect the access address of the generated page.
