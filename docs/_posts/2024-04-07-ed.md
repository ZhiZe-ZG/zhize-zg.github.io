## Introduction

Ed (also write as "ed") is an old text editor. It was first released on Unix. The link cited above points to the GNU implementation of ed. Unlike most text editors today, it does not automatically display the entire text file content. You need to use commands to make it display certain parts of the file. This usage was probably designed for early typewriter terminals. It makes ed closer to awk or sed with an interactive command line, rather than today's interactive text editors. To a certain extent, it influenced the operating mode of later text editors such as vi.

As a matter of interest or historical research, it makes sense to learn about Ed. But as a tool, I personally don’t recommend Ed very much. As a manually operated software, its ease of use and functionality are obviously not as good as modern text editors. As a text processing tool that requires interaction with text commands, it is inferior to awk or sed.
