## Introduction

Font file format, which belongs to the OpenType font file format. But OpenType defines two specific formats, and this is one of them. It's related to Adobe's PostScript.

This format has various suffixes, but I generally use `.otf` as the suffix. There is also a way of using `.otc` to represent a collection of such font formats, but treating `.otc` as another file format.

PostScript-flavored OpenType can be used as a replacement for the PostScript Type 1 font. The PostScript Type 1 standard is old and deprecated. PostScript Type 1 related file formats are not documented here. For more about PostScript Type 1, refer to:

* [Adobe Type Tools - Font Technical Notes](https://adobe-type-tools.github.io/font-tech-notes/)

Besides, `.otf` can also be used as a suffix for TrueType-flavored fonts. If a TrueType-flavored font uses `.otf`, then it is considered an OTF.
