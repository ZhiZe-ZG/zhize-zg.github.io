## Introduction

Standard set by MPEG to replace MP3. It is essentially an encoding format that can generally be put into a container such as MP4, but it can also just be packaged into an audio file. This description is for a file format that contains only AAC-encoded audio (that is, ADTS containers, see: [Media container formats (file types)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Containers)).
