## Introduction

An editable document file container format.

Its usage scenarios are highly overlapped with DOCX, and some functions are not as good as DOCX. But more importantly, if you give up the need to package all the content in the document into a file that can be directly read and written, then there are many better options such as HTML+CSS+JS, TeX, Markdown, etc.
