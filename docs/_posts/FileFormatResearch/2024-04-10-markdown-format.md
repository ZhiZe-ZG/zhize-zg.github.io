## Introduction

Markdown was originally a markup document format without strict standards and was later standardized by CommonMark. But beyond that, there are numerous extension syntaxes. For example, GitHub's GitHub Flavored Markdown and the Markdown extensions supported by Typora, etc.

I still uses CommonMark as the only Markdown standard. Extended syntax not included in CommonMark can be used, but is not required to be supported by every editing tool. Since the Markdown source code itself is quite readable, even if some extended syntax content is not rendered, the source code is still highly readable.

Here are some of the main Markdown extensions:

* [GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/): A extension by GitHub. Add tables, task list and autolinks etc.
* [KaTeX](https://katex.org/): LaTeX-like math formula markup language.
* [Mermaid](http://mermaid.js.org/): A language for describing diagrams and charts.
* [Typora](https://typora.io/): Markdown syntax extension supported by Typora. It is basically an integration of several Markdown extensions and has certain configurability.
