## Introduction

A format created to simulate paper documents and printed documents. All command messages are essentially commands used to control the printing process. In addition, it is often used for the effect presentation of electronic typeset materials and some electronic publishing.

In addition to being a document format, it is also sometimes used as a vector graphics format (for example, in LaTeX).

Since commands in PDF may not retain the original semantic structure, it is generally not recommended to modify PDF documents directly. Instead, you can modify the source file from which the PDF was generated and then regenerate the PDF.
