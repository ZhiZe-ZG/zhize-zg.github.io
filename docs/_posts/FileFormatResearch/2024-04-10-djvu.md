## Introduction

DjVu is a file format specifically optimized for scanning documents. It can be used as a pixel image file format or a document file format.

According to its official page, it provides better compression than PDF and JPG in terms of storage of scanned documents, and it also provides some OCR-related support.

But for now, DjVu’s high-quality encoders are still monopolized by commercial companies (refer to: [DjVu Official Site](https://djvu.sourceforge.net/)):

> Windows and Mac versions of the viewer/plug-in, free Windows compressors, and high-end commercial compressors and OCR engines are available from LizardTech Inc.. The compressors provided here are slower, produce larger files (sometimes with lower image quality) than the commercial compressors, but they do the job.

This makes building and editing DjVu somewhat difficult.
