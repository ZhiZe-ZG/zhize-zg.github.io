## Introduction

7Z is an archive compression format that is newer than ZIP. The compression ratio of the default algorithm is better than ZIP, but it is generally considered to consume more computing power than ZIP.

It is not as popular as ZIP and does not serve as the basis for many file formats like ZIP. Therefore, it has a different ecological niche than ZIP.

If you are pursuing a better compression ratio or some new features provided by 7Z, and do not need the popularity support of ZIP, you can use 7Z.
