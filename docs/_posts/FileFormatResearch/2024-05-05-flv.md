## Introduction

An audio and video file format that could previously be played by Adobe Flash. Now with the demise of Flash, there is no need to keep it.

It should be noted that there are two types of flv, one is consistent with the swf encoding method, and the other is consistent with the mp4 encoding method.

Due to security issues with Adobe Flash and its discontinuation of updates, it is recommended not to use this format.
