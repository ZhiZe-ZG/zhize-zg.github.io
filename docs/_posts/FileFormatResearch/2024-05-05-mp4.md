## Introduction

MP4 is a common audio and video container formats and it can be used to package audio or video separately, but are generally used to package both audio and video.

MP4 has a variety of optional suffixes, but it is recommended not to use suffixes other than ".mp4" to prevent confusion. Because some MP4 suffixes reflect different container contents, and some are not. They are given the same series of suffixes just because they are related to MP4. In addition, Apple has created a bunch of messy suffixes to represent the same type of files, further increasing the confusion of MP4 suffixes. Therefore, it is agreed that as long as MP4 is used as a container, `.mp4` will be used as the suffix to prevent confusion, and `.m4a`, `.m4v` and other suffixes will not be used.
