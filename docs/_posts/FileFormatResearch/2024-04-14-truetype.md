## Introduction

TTF is a font file format and belongs to the OpenType font file format. But OpenType defines two specific formats, and this is one of them.

In addition, this file format has an inheritance relationship with the old TrueType whose suffix is also `.ttf`. Generally, there is no need to make a complete distinction from the previous TrueType. Because systems that support TrueType-flavored OpenType generally also support the old TrueType format. But this format may support more features than the old TrueType. So, I treat TrueType and TrueType-flavored OpenType as the same file type.

This format has various suffixes, but I generally just use `.ttf` as the file suffix for files with a single font. There is also a way to use `.ttc` to represent a collection of font formats, but `.ttc` is considered another file type.

More about suffix, refer to:

* [Microsoft Build: OpenType Specification - Filenames](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/recom#filenames)

If it is not for old system compatibility, it is recommended to treat TrueType-flavored OpenType as part of OpenType and use the `.otf` suffix.
